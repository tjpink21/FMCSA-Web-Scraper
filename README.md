# FMCSA-Web-Scraper
Web scrapper I made during my internship at RFF

It takes in a file containing "slow data" from various trucks. From this data, 
it extracts a list of DOT numbers and saves various webpages on each number (as permitted by the user). 
It will go to each webpage for each DOT number and scrape the important data from it.
This data is compiled into a single excel file, and can be used for analysis.
